# Slope & Distance Calculator

## What is This
- This is a mini-project in which I learned how to programmatically draw a perpendicular bisector between two points in a coordinate system.

## Why I did this
- Because drawing a perpendicular bisector is a key step in [one algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2c3kumwoAk&list=PL6FZxwkXzEZEwtjkj9MNWYiZxhP7qcTRg&index=4&t=162s) for generating [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

## Why do I Want to Generate a Voronoi Diagram
- Because I want to [generate a texture](http://texture-pattern.herokuapp.com/) which looks like a [close-up shot of the cells on a plant](https://res.cloudinary.com/fleetnation/image/private/c_fit,w_1120/g_south,l_text:style_gothic2:%C2%A9%20Ashley%20Cooper,o_20,y_10/g_center,l_watermark4,o_25,y_50/v1494545119/h6g8ofiitbehqb9wgl6p.jpg). A Voronoi diagram is not the most realistic option, but it's close enough for me to call that project 'finished'.

## Why do I Want to Generate Such a Texture
- Enough questions, grasshopper!
